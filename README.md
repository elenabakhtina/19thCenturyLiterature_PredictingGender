# Analysing 19th-century classical literature to predict authorsâ€™ genders by their literary works.

My idea behind this project is to explore whether changes in social order that we've observed in the last 150 years effect such a cultural constract as "gender". There are many possible ways to approach this task. I'll be doing it by analyzing language (more specifically written texts). My assumption here is that both gender and language are learned skills, we are not born knowing that we are men or women and we are not born speaking any particular language. We learn both of these skills through social interactions, and we learn them not in isolation but in connection with each other, thus there is a correlation.  

I'm starting with classical literature of 19th century, which is my first research in a series of few.

To get the data, I visited [the Gutenberg Project](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page). Altogether my data contain novels and short stories written by 60 authors (30 men/30 women). Because my original texts varied in lengh, from multi-volume novels to one-page short stories, I needed to split the texts into smaller texts of roughly the same lengh. I tried splitting by a predefined number of lines and by paragraph.
