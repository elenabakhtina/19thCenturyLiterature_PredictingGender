# Analysing 19th-century classical literature to predict authorsâ€™ genders by their literary works.

My idea behind this project is to explore whether changes in social order that we've observed in the last 150 years effect such a cultural constract as "gender". There are many possible ways to approach this task. I'll be doing it by analyzing written language. My assumption here is that both gender and language are learned skills, we are not born knowing that we are men or women and we are not born speaking any particular language. We learn both of these skills through social interactions, and we learn them not in isolation from each other but in connection, thus there is a correlation.  

I'm starting with classical literature of 19th century, which is a first research in a series of few.
